Bluetooth Voice Controlled Robot

This project implements a Bluetooth voice-controlled robotic vehicle that responds to spoken commands from a smartphone. Voice inputs are converted into control signals and transmitted wirelessly via Bluetooth to the robot, enabling real-time movement control.

The robot can perform actions such as forward, backward, left, right, and stop, making it a hands-free and user-friendly system. The project demonstrates the practical integration of wireless communication, embedded systems, and motor control, highlighting applications in smart robotics and assistive technologies.
